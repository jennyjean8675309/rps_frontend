ABOUT

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Fight! is a card-based twist on the classic game. Check out the 'How to Play' page for detailed information on how the game works.

User stats (highest scores, highest number of consecutive wins, and highest percentage of wins) are stored in the backend database for users who create an account. Authentication is done using JWTs (or JSON Web Tokens).

Most of the styling is done using Semantic UI React.
